I walked into this one with an open mind. For context, I’m a Batman guy through and through — so if there’s ever a chance to thrash Superman, I’ll usually take it. But I meant it when I said this: I _wanted_ to like this movie. No bias, no agenda to defend it.

That said… it was okayish.

Visually? Banger. Some shots were genuinely insane — and the theme song? Goat-level stuff. Like, I’d listen to it on repeat. [Here’s the one I’m talking about](https://open.spotify.com/track/16TmU1IOCBQxBSF5qb3GWt?si=414646e86ef544b2).

David Corenswet was fine. Henry Cavill still lives rent-free in my head as _the_ Superman, but David didn’t fumble. He did what he had to. I get the angle they were going for — a grounded, more “human” Superman — and I respect that. A lot of people might be disappointed that he didn’t feel godlike enough, but given the story, this version kinda made sense.

The story, though? Way too safe. Felt more like a Saturday morning cartoon origin story — the kind you’d recommend to kids just getting into superheroes. Not something that sticks if you've grown up watching capes fly and cities crumble in 4K.

Action? Decent but short-lived. I was lowkey hoping for a mid-air slugfest or two. The flight scenes looked cool, but nothing hit hard.

What really pulled it down was the dialogue. Some scenes had potential (like the one with his dad), but they didn’t _land_. It felt like someone assembled this movie like a jigsaw puzzle — force-fitting pieces that almost work, but don’t lock perfectly.

Would I recommend it? Sure — to someone new to the superhero world. But if you’re like me and have grown up dunking on Superman while secretly wanting a movie that proves you wrong — this isn’t quite it.
