Felt like it was about time I dumped some raw thoughts about what gaming really means to me.

It’s something that’s stuck with me through a bunch of different phases in life — from button-mashing on a dusty console in Kenya to late-night Valorant queues after work.

This graph probably does a better job than words at summarizing the ups, downs, and lock-in eras.

## 🎮 Plugged In Since 2002

I was in Kenya, 3 years old, and completely unaware of what a console even was. But my then neighbour, whom I would call _Raja Bhaiya_, had one — a dusty Famicom clone that plugged into a TV with red-yellow-white wires. No saves, no instructions, just chaos. And I was hooked.

A few months later, my parents got me a PS One. That was it — I was in.  
**Tekken 3**, **FIFA 02**, **Motocross**, **Spider-Man (2000)**, and so many more!

Also had early access to my dad’s chunky old PC, where I played janky educational games, a cursed **Pingu** title, and clicked my way through low-res worlds with a mouse the size of a brick.

These weren’t just pastimes. They were core memories.

## 🧠 The Consoles I Earned

When I was six, I wanted a Gameboy Advance badly.  
My dad said I’d only get it if I scored A++ in all my exams.

So I did.

I still remember holding his hand, walking into the store, picking out **Power Rangers: Ninja Storm**, **Tetris**, **Grand Theft Auto**, **The Lion King** and a 169-in-1 cassette. That wasn’t just a gift — it was a victory lap.

Same thing years later — my PS4 was a celebration for scoring 95% in my 10th boards.  
These consoles weren’t just bought. They were **earned**. And maybe that’s why they’ve always meant more than just tech.

## 🖥️ The Setup Now

I grew up on consoles — PS One → Gameboy Advance → PSP → PS4.

Now? It’s full desktop sweat:

- Ryzen 5600G + RTX 4060 Ti
- 144 Hz 2K monitor
- Keychron K2 v2
- Aerox 3 Wireless mouse (lightweight, clean flicks)

I’m still planning to get a PS5 — not for flex, but because **GTA VI** deserves to be experienced _right_.

## 🕹️ What I Play (and Why)

### 💥 Valorant: The Daily Grind

My main. 2000+ hours deep.  
I flex between **Raze**, **Omen**, **Cypher**, and **KAY/O** depending on team comp and mood.

Mostly unrated — ranked on Mumbai servers is a rage trap. If I play ranked, it’s Singapore or bust.  
Mental peace is part of the build.

I even got into eSports because of this game — and yeah, I’m a **Sentinels** fan. TenZ clears.

### 🌌 The Unwind Games: Solo Escapes

Some nights, I want story, combat, puzzles, peace.

Games like **Red Dead Redemption 2**, **Spider-Man**, **Batman: Arkham Knight**, **Uncharted 4**, and newer drops like **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**.

If it’s got:

- A compelling world
- Snappy combat
- Hidden lore
- Dumb little easter eggs

I’m all in.

### 👾 With The Gang: Co-Op Chaos

When Valorant gets too sweaty, we hop into games like:

- **Overcooked 2**
- **GTA Online**
- **Content Warning**
- **Raft**

It’s less about strategy, more about shouting over Discord and healing via chaos.  
Yelling “who took the damn rice off the stove?!” is real bonding.

## ⏳ The Lock-In Era

Peak COVID was our golden gaming age. We had a 9-5 schedule, except it was:

- 9 PM – 12 AM: Valorant
- 12 AM – 1 AM: Rocket League
- 1 AM – 5 AM: GTA Online

Every. Single. Night.  
For months.

We’d argue over GTA heist splits like we were actually laundering money.  
Uncontrollable laughter, rage moments, mic muting, team kills — the full arc in one night.  
I’d kill to have those nights back.

## 🔄 From Joy to Identity

At first, gaming was just... fun.

But over time, it became more:

- A way to feel in control when life wasn’t
- A space to _win_ when the outside world handed out Ls
- A place to be **Spider31415**, not just Aniket with deadlines

Gaming gave me focus when I was scattered.  
Peace when I was overwhelmed.  
Confidence when nothing else was going right.

These weren’t just digital victories — they _translated_.  
If I could beat a 20-min brutal boss fight, I could survive Monday too.

## 🧱 The Rule That Built Me

> _Can’t end on a loss._

It started in Valorant. Lost a match? Queue again. You _have_ to end on a win.

Somewhere along the way, it leaked into life.

Bad day?  
Cringe moment?  
Big miss?

Cool.  
Queue another.

This isn’t some LinkedIn quote about resilience.  
It’s just something gaming wired into me — slowly, naturally.

**Lose → Reset → Try again → Win → Rest.**

That became my rhythm.

## 🎮 Why I’ll Keep Playing

People grow out of things.  
I didn’t grow out of gaming — I grew _into_ it.

Because no matter what I’m juggling — work, stress, life chaos — I can always come back to a match, a mission, or a messy Overcooked kitchen.

Gaming isn’t my distraction.  
It’s my reminder:

That I’ve earned good things.  
That I can win again.  
That I’m still here, still queuing up for one more.

> _Can’t end on a loss._

That started in a game.  
But now it’s how I live.
