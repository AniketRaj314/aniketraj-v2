Every morning, my Google Home fades in with _[Time](https://youtu.be/c56t7upa8Bk?si=g05y7jJW3tK-t1Pr)_ from the movie Inception at sunrise.  
No alarms. No jolts. Just a slow, swelling reminder that the day has begun.  
Then another track queues up.  
And just like that - the mood is set, the film starts rolling, and I’m the guy brushing his teeth like he’s in a Nolan montage.

Most of my day plays out to background scores. Not by accident.  
It’s just the kind of music that fits. I’ve only recently started putting words to it, but I’ve realised this:

> I don’t just _listen_ to music. I _live_ in it.

## It’s less about the music. More about the moment.

I’m not trying to hype myself up or fill silence. I’m setting a vibe.  
Whether I’m getting ready, working, lifting, or just blankly staring into the abyss - there’s usually something playing. And lyrics? Sometimes they’re too... loud.  
They jump in with answers when I’m still figuring out the question.

That’s why OSTs (Original Sound Tracks) make sense.  
They hold space. They don’t intrude.  
They let the “main character energy” simmer while I’m doing something as niche as building a new Lego set.

## Where it all began: A kid, a movie, and mp3skull

I was 12 when I walked out of _The Amazing Spider-Man_ in 2012.  
Came home buzzing. Sketched Spider-Man suits. Did my science homework to feel like Peter Parker (minus the radioactivity).  
Then I found the soundtrack on mp3skull - peak Internet era.

That’s when the realisation hit:  
**“I can just relive the movie by listening to its OSTs?”**

_[Saving New York](https://youtu.be/aEzVtVHMfrM?si=G2rVCQdvkPAFtwnr)_ was the exact moment.  
I played it — and without seeing a single frame, my mind _replayed the entire scene_.  
Spidey running wounded, cranes lining up, Gwen in danger, the city holding its breath.  
No visuals. Just chords. Just emotion.  
It felt like cinematic VR before it was even a thing.

And that flipped the switch. OSTs = memory machines.

## I’m not playing songs. I’m cueing moments.

Depending on the mood, I know exactly what to play.  
I’ve never written it down before - but turns out, I’ve been silently scoring my life this whole time.

They let me feel like the main character, even when I’m just brushing my teeth.

## Lyrics still have their place

Don’t get me wrong - I _do_ listen to lyrical stuff.  
But I reach for it when the emotion needs help forming a sentence.

_Fix You_ by Coldplay hit me in 12th grade.  
Boards, heartbreaks, friendships on life support - all happening at once.  
That first verse? It captured everything I was feeling:

> _When you try your best, but you don't succeed..._  
> _When you get what you want, but not what you need..._  
> _When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep..._  
> _Stuck in reverse..._

Then the guitar kicks in — soft at first, then gradually swelling into something powerful.  
A quiet signal that maybe, just maybe, things will be okay.  
It didn’t just sit with the sadness — it pulled you _through_ it.  
From breakdown to breakthrough.

Same goes for:

- Cigarettes After Sex (a hopeless romantic’s best friend)
- Linkin Park (for all the feels growing up)
- Snow Patrol (shoutout _[New York](https://youtu.be/mIlNguMTPXI?si=K8p1bNTE3zCHBLPJ)_, you’re beautiful)

Sometimes, you _need_ words.  
But most days, I just need the vibe.

You can even peek into my real-time music brain — I built a [Music page](/music) that shows exactly what I’m listening to on Spotify. Top tracks, favorite artists, current vibe. No filters. Just the raw soundtrack of my days.

## This year, the music came to life

2025 hit different. I got to see three of my top 5 artists _live_.  
Let me run you through the trilogy:

- **Coldplay (Mumbai)**  
  Visual spectacle off the charts.  
  But _Fix You_? That’s when the voice cracked. That’s when the lump hit the throat. That’s when everyone around me became background actors in _my_ moment.

- **Cigarettes After Sex (Mumbai)**  
  Beer in one hand, cigarette in the other, friends by my side.  
  Everyone around in black, but the mood was quietly electric.  
  John Wayne playing in the background.  
  Nostalgic one-sided love? Yeah, check.

- **Hans Zimmer (Abu Dhabi)**  
  Top artist 3 years in a row. No hesitation - I flew out, and it ended up being my best decision.  
  Dune opened strong. _Mombasa_ brought the energy.  
  Then came _Dark Knight_, _Man of Steel_, _Wonder Woman_.  
  But what really pushed me to the edge of my seat was: _Interstellar_ → _Lion King_ → _Inception_. Back. To. Back.

  _Interstellar_ got me misty.  
  _Lion King_ had me choked up.  
  And _Time_... well, _Time_ broke me.

> Imagine listening to a 128 kbps rip from mp3skull on your Nokia in 2015  
> Now imagine the composer playing it live in front of you in 2025.

That’s not a concert. That’s a cinematic redemption arc.

## The final scene (for now)

I used to think: “Mehh, same song, different volume. Why pay for it live?”  
Well, now I get it.

You feel the bass in your chest.  
You see your memories reflected in a crowd of strangers.  
And suddenly, you’re not just _hearing_ the track.  
You’re _inside_ it.

So yeah, I listen to songs. Love lyrics.  
But OSTs are the invisible threads that hold it all together.  
They play when I wake up.  
When I crash.  
When I rise again.  
When I brush my teeth like I’m walking away from an explosion in slow motion.

Because in my head, it’s never just a song - it’s a scene.
