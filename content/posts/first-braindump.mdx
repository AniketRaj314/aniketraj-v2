## Turns out... I just needed to walk more

When I stopped relying on sticky notes for every task, I noticed my brain had more breathing room.  
Now, I just take short walks and dump thoughts into Notion or Apple Notes later.

### A few reasons why this worked for me:

- Less visual clutter on my desk
- More intentional screen time
- Physical movement helped process ideas

~~No more sticky notes everywhere~~
