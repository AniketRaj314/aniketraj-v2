Okay so I'm in a meeting rn, and my ADHD shifted my focus on getting this done.

Just pushing out these pending changes. The next thing I need to check is to allow for more MDX syntax
to be supported. Something as simple as a strikethrough.

I'm gonna push this for now. Let's see. I should get back to my meeting.
