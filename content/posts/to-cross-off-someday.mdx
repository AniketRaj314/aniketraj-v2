I’m sitting in the Network School library at a Writer’s Room that Ashwin and I put together. I hadn’t really planned what I was going to write; that’s the whole point of a braindump. Whatever I think, I process, I put it down, refine, and move on.  

I plugged in my earphones, and the first song that played was [Remember](https://youtu.be/RakhywpkY-k?si=svmEntvaNAojRVI5) from **The Lion King by Hans Zimmer**. Suddenly, I was back at the concert where I heard it live. That small loop between the song, the memory, and the moment reminded me of my bucket list; of things I’ve crossed off and the many still waiting.

### ~**The Crossed-Off Ones**~

🎵 **Attend Hans Zimmer Live**  
Cinematic feels on a stage? Yes please. Flew down to Abu Dhabi and witnessed it happen. It felt like stepping inside the music I’ve lived with for years.  

🌈 **Attend Coldplay Live**  
Missed the 2016 India concert because of board exams. Finally made it happen this time and sang till my throat gave up.  

🚂 **Do a Non-Conventional Hackathon**  
Helped put together BlockTrain, Asia’s first hackathon on rails. Doing it in India basically meant playing life on hard mode, and it worked.  

🌄 **Go on a Digital Detox in the Valleys**  
Did it during a solo trip to Lonavala. No screens, no noise, just thinking. Came back lighter and clearer.  

🖥️ **Build a PC of My Own**  
Childhood dream, finally done with my own savings. Something about pressing that power button for the first time still hits.

### **The List That Keeps Growing**

🚅 **Ride the Japan Bullet Train**  
Trains, anime, gaming, order in chaos. Japan is the intersection of everything I love. This one’s not just about the ride, it’s about feeling the hum of a country that builds its future every day.  

🧪 **Tour CERN’s Super Collider**  
Math and Physics have always fascinated me. Visiting the place where particles collide feels like stepping inside the sci-fi stories I grew up with. The Flash comics made it fiction, CERN makes it real.  

🎮 **Watch a VCT Match in a Stadium**  
Valorant’s been my home turf for years. The clutches, the comebacks, the chaos. I live for it on screen. Experiencing that energy in a stadium might just overload my heart.  

🤝 **Meet the Sentinels and PRX Rosters**  
Two teams that shaped my love for esports. Meeting them IRL would be like closing the loop between fan and creator.  

🌊 **Go Snorkelling in Australia**  
Coral reefs are the real show down there, and I want to see them up close. (And yes, the Great Barrier Reef is as magical as it sounds.)  

🌌 **See the Northern Lights**  
Probably Norway. Something about colors painting the sky feels like a reminder that nature still makes the best screensaver.  

⚽ **Take My Family to the FIFA World Cup**  
My dad’s FIFA obsession is legendary. Late-night matches, shared reactions, friendly arguments. Watching it together live would make years of those moments worth it.  

The list doesn’t end here. It keeps growing quietly in the background, shaped by new obsessions, random discoveries, and late-night ideas that refuse to leave my notes app.

### **What the List Really Means**

Every time I cross something off, it feels like finishing a level I’ve been stuck on for years. That brief moment where everything goes silent, and you just take a deep breath and let it sink in. It’s proof that I can do things, that I can move mountains when I care enough.  

When I was younger, I thought bucket lists were fixed, like checkpoints you hit and you’re done. But life keeps changing, and so do I. What felt important five years ago might not matter today, and something I discover tomorrow might feel life-defining. The list is never final, and that’s the beauty of it.  

Maybe it’s the thrill of completing items you care about rather than the item itself, so always keep open for more.
